Step 2-3. In the "Localisation" adjust all items (i.e., Locale, Timezone, Keyboard, and Wireless LAN Country. ). Please make double sure that `Wireless LAN Country` is selected properly. Otherwise, the R-Pi will not be able to connect to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 3. Connect to Wi-Fi.** You don't HAVE TO connect to Wi-Fi while you are in Somsen 312 class. Because you will be provided with an ethernet cable. But you will need to connect to Wi-Fi in anywhere else. Currently, Raspberry Pi only connects to WSU-Guest Network.
