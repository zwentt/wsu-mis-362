# 2.6 Connect to Pi Using SSH

You can connect to your Pi using SSH, to remotely execute Linux command using Terminal. While VNC provides a remote connection solution with a graphical user interface, SSH only provides Terminal connection. To connect, please follow the following syntax carefully. 

```
ssh username@IP_address
```

For example, if your username is `pi`, and your IP address is `192.168.0.101`, then you will need to type 

```
ssh pi@192.168.0.101
```

Once connected, please try the following command (to have fun.)

```shell
sudo apt-get install cmatrix
```

Once the installation is finished, then 

``` shell
cmatrix
```

To exit the program, please press `ctrl + c` key combination.
