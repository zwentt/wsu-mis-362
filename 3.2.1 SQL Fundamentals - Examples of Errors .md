# 3.2.1 SQL Fundamentals - Examples of Errors 

Following SQL commands will cause errors.

> :warning: This is the continuation from previous [section 3.2](https://zwentt.github.io/wsu-mis-362/3.2%20SQL%20Fundamentals%20Creating%20Database%20and%20Tables). I assume you have successfully completed all the way until 3.2.

### 1. Non-unique Primary Key

This following `INSERT` command will not go through. Because we already have a person with the `person_id = 1` (the person has a `fname = 'William'`

```sql
INSERT INTO person (person_id, fname)
VALUES
	(1, 'John');
```

Also, remember that the primary key `person_id` was defined as a non-negative and auto-incrementing integer. So it is not a good idea to explicitly assign a `person_id`.

### 2. Non-existing Foreign Key 

A foreign key is a column or many columns in a table who values correspond to the values of the primary key in another table. In our example, the `person_id` is a primary key in `person` table. But also a foreign key in the `favorite_food` table. 

It will cause an error if we attempt to use a foreign key that does not exist. 

For example, the following command will cause an error, because `person_id = 999`  does not yet exist. 

```sql
INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
VALUES
	(999, 'lasagna')
```



### 3. Column Value Violations 

It occurs when we attempt to add or update a record without adhering to the value requirement of a column. 

For example, the following command will be considered problematic because we decided to use only one of three eye colors when we initially define the `eye_color` column. (Recall  `eye_color ENUM('BR', 'BL', 'GR')` )

```sql
INSERT INTO person (person_id, eye_color)
VALUES
	(null, 'XK');
```

It may still executes. But we can see the details of the warning messages by: 

```sql
SHOW WARNINGS;
```

The following command will also cause an error, because it is not keeping the date format. By the default, a date should be supplied in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD` , but it is offered as `MMM-DD-YYYY`. 

```sql
UPDATE person
SET birth_date = 'DEC-21-1980'
WHERE person_id = 3;
```

**This concludes the module.** :end:
