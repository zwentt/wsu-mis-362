# Install VirtualBox Software on a Windows System

Step 1. Double click the installation file - `VirtualBox-version-number-Win.exe`  (Note: In the file name, `.exe` is called file extension. It tells user what type of file it is. The extension`exe` means it is an executable file. You maybe thinking, all files I have been clicking "executes" a program? But that is not true. When you click a file, the operating system automatically launches the default program, usually an executable file, that can open the type of file. )You will be greeted by the following screen. Click next.
