# 3.4 More SQL Exercises

In this exercise, we will be running many different queries using SQL to achieve a better understanding in working with database. 

When a potential query is long, you will find it helpful to write a query using the following tool below (or any of text editors of your choice such as [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (Windows Only, Open Source)and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (macOS and Windows, free for a period), then copy it to the MariaDB for execution. (Note: this is called the "workflow")

### 1. Query Clauses 

We are going to practice more on those query clauses. 

| Clause   | What it Does                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SELECT   | Determine which columns to include in the query's result set |
| FROM     | Identifies the tables from which to retrieve data and how the tables should be joined |
| WHERE    | Filters out unwanted data                                    |
| ORDER BY | Sorts the rows of the final result set by one or more columns |



### 2.1 Examples for `SELECT` & `FROM`  (Single Table)

`SELECT` is essentially a **projecting** action - selectively display columns in a table. 

Let's use the `film` table as an example in this case. 

```mariadb
DESC film;
```

It will show a list of all the fields (or attributes or columns) in the table. 

The following command will display all attributes from all records (or rows). 

```mariadb
SELECT * FROM film;
```

To see only `film_id`, `title`, and `rental_rate` , we can do

```mariadb
SELECT film_id, title, rental_rate
FROM film; 
```

Note that in case you did not choose `sakila` as the current database, you need to use the following commands. **Do you see the difference?** 

```mariadb
SELECT film_id, title, rental_rate
FROM sakila.film; 
```

`SELECT` can also be **useful** when trying to find out the number of rows in a table. 

```mariadb
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film; 
```

In combination with `DISTINCT`, `SELECT` can display after removing duplicated records. 

```mariadb
SELECT DISTINCT actor_id, film_id
FROM film_actor
ORDER BY actor_id;
```



### 2.2 Examples for `WHERE`

`WHERE` is essentially a **selecting** action - selectively display rows in a given table. 

To display all the records have `film_id` less than 50: 

```mariadb
SELECT film_id, title, rental_rate
FROM film
WHERE film_id < 50; 
```

To see how many films have `film_id` less than 50? 

```mariadb
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM film
WHERE film_id < 50; 
```

To see implement two different criteria, for example, to see films with `G` rating and the `rental_duration` not shorter than 7 days: 

```mariadb
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE
	rating = 'G' AND rental_duration >= 7; 
```

What about `G` rating or the `rental_duration` not shorter than 7 days:

```mariadb
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE
	rating = 'G' OR NOT(rental_duration < 7); 
```

To search a movie name that begins with `G`, we can use a wildcard keyword `%` , which represents any number of characters:

```mariadb
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE 
	title LIKE 'G%'; 
```



### 2.3 Examples for `SELECT` & `FROM` - Two Tables

This step requires a **joining** action, where a query needs to run based on a combination of two tables. 

```mariadb
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM 
	customer c
	JOIN
	address a; 
```

You can also do, but the earlier step is more concise. 

```mariadb
SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, address.address
FROM 
	customer JOIN address; 
```

But this action did a pairwise matching to all the customers to all the addresses. This is not what we want. We want to see a customer-address match based on a key that both tables share together - `address_id` . Remember that this key is a primary key at the `address` table, but is a `foreign key` in the `customer` table. Therefore, this is a better approach: 

```mariadb
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, a.address
FROM 
	customer c
	JOIN
	address a
ON	
	c.address_id = a.address_id; 
```



Before you move on, please see if you understand the following ideas: 

- [ ] Selecting rows in a table
- [ ] Projecting attributes a table 
- [ ] Joining two tables

**This concludes the activity.**
